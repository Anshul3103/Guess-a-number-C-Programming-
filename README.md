# Guess the number (C Programming)

This Project is about Guessing a number between 1 to 100 in which a number is generated randomly and user has to guess it with some conditions. If the user enters a number which is less than the actual number generated then it will give an output as higher number and if the user enters a number which is higher than the actual number generated then it will give output as enter lower number and this process will continue until the right choice is made.
As soon as the choice is made the loop exits with a message printing in how many attempts did the user completed the game.
